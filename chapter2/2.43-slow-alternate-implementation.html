    <h1>Exercise 2.43</h1>
    <p>Louis Reasoner is having a terrible time doing exercise 2.42. His <code>queens</code> procedure seems to work, but it runs extremely slowly. (Lous never does manage to wait long enough for it to solve even the 6 $\times$ 6 case.) When Louis asks Eva Lu Ator for help, she points out that he has interchanged the order of the nested mapping in the <code>flatmap</code>, writing it as: <br>
      <p>
        <pre>
          (flatmap
           (lambda (new-row)
             (map (lambda (rest-of-queens)
                    (adjoin-position new-row k rest-of-queens))
                  (queen-cols (- k 1))))
           (enumerate-interval 1 board-size))
        </pre>
      </p>
    <p>Explain why this interchange makes the program run slowly. Estimate how long it will take Louis's program to solve the eight-queens puzzle, assuming that the program in exercise 2.42 solves the puzzle in time $T$.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <p>
      Louis' implementation is computing <code>queen-cols</code> <code>board-size</code> number of times, then if the regular implementation takes $T$ time to solve it, Louis' implementation will take $T^k$ time, where $k$ is the size of the board.
