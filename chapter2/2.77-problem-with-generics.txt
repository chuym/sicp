When Louis Reasoner constructs his complex number, he will end up having something like:
('(complex) . (rectangular) . (3 5)

So when the method (magnitude) is called through apply-generic, it retrieves the tag:
'(complex)

And attempts to look for a '(magnitude) procedure defined for the tag '(complex), since it
doesn't exist, the procedure call fails.

apply-generic is called twice, the first time it tries to look for a magnitude method udner the
'(complex) tag, since we just proxy that call to the generic magnitude method, it does another
apply-generic call, but this time calling looking for the '(rectangular) tag (as per the example above)
